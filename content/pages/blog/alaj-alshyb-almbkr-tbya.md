<div style="text-align: left">Certainly! Here's the translation:



**Premature graying** occurs when hair turns gray or white earlier than expected. The causes of premature graying are diverse and include genetic, environmental, and health-related factors. Below are the most common causes:



1\. **Genetic Factors**

*   *   If one or both parents or grandparents experienced premature graying, you are likely to have the same predisposition.



2\. **Oxidative Stress**

*   *   **Free radicals** damage cells, including the cells responsible for producing melanin (the pigment that gives hair its color).



3\. **Vitamin and Mineral Deficiencies**

**Vitamin B12**: A deficiency in this vitamin is directly linked to premature graying as it impacts melanin production.

**Copper, Zinc, and Iron**: These minerals are essential for maintaining healthy hair and pigmentation.



4\. **Psychological Stress and Chronic Tension**

Mental stress increases the release of certain hormones that can affect hair follicles and reduce melanin production.

Recent studies associate stress with damage to the stem cells responsible for regenerating pigment.



5\. **Thyroid Disorders**

Issues such as **hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism** affect the hair growth cycle and may lead to loss of natural hair color.



6\. **Exposure to Pollutants and Toxins**

Prolonged exposure to environmental pollutants, such as cigarette smoke and chemicals, can accelerate the graying process.



7\. **Autoimmune Diseases**

Some autoimmune diseases, such as **vitiligo** or **alopecia areata**, affect melanin production, causing patches of white or gray hair on the scalp.



8\. **Smoking**

Smoking increases the risk of premature graying due to its negative effects on blood circulation and hair follicle health.



9\. **Rare Genetic Disorders**

Certain genetic disorders, such as **Werner syndrome** or **hereditary vitiligo**, cause premature graying as part of their symptoms.



10\. **Using Damaging Hair Products**

Overuse of styling products or exposure to harsh chemicals (e.g., dyes and bleaching agents) can damage melanin-producing cells.



11\. **Accelerated Biological Aging (Early Aging)**

Some individuals experience accelerated biological aging due to genetic or environmental factors, resulting in earlier onset of gray hair.



Prevention or Mitigation:

Follow a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals.

Manage stress through exercise and meditation.

Avoid smoking and limit exposure to environmental pollutants.

Consult a doctor if you suspect an underlying health issue, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid disorders.

Identifying the main cause of premature graying is the first step toward effective treatment or prevention.
